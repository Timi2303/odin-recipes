    <h3>Here's the list of ingredients for preparing Egg Rolls:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Egg roll wrappers</li>
  <li>Ground pork or chicken</li>
  <li>Shredded cabbage</li>
  <li>Shredded carrots</li>
  <li>Chopped onions</li>
  <li>Minced garlic</li>
  <li>Soy sauce</li>
  <li>Oyster sauce</li>
  <li>Sesame oil</li>
  <li>Salt</li>
  <li>Black pepper</li>
  <li>Cornstarch (for sealing the wrappers)</li>
  <li>Vegetable oil (for frying)</li>
</ul>

 <h3>And here are the steps for cooking Egg Rolls:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>In a large skillet or wok, heat some vegetable oil over medium-high heat.</li>
  <li>Add the ground pork or chicken to the hot oil and cook until browned, breaking it up into small pieces with a spatula or spoon.</li>
  <li>Add the chopped onions and minced garlic to the skillet. Stir-fry for a few minutes until the onions are translucent.</li>
  <li>Add the shredded cabbage and carrots to the skillet. Stir-fry for a few more minutes until the vegetables are slightly tender.</li>
  <li>In a small bowl, mix together soy sauce, oyster sauce, sesame oil, salt, and black pepper. Pour the sauce mixture over the meat and vegetable mixture in the skillet. Stir-fry everything together for a couple of minutes to combine the flavors. Remove from heat and let the filling cool.</li>
  <li>Take an egg roll wrapper and place it on a clean surface in a diamond shape, with one corner facing you.</li>
  <li>Place a spoonful of the cooled filling near the bottom corner of the wrapper, leaving some space on the sides. Fold the bottom corner over the filling and roll it up halfway.</li>
  <li>Fold the sides of the wrapper toward the center, then continue rolling tightly until you reach the top corner. Dab some cornstarch mixed with water on the top corner to seal the wrapper.</li>
  <li>Repeat the process with the remaining wrappers and filling.</li>
  <li>In a deep saucepan or deep-fryer, heat vegetable oil to about 350°F (175°C).</li>
  <li>Carefully place the prepared egg rolls into the hot oil, a few at a time, and fry until they turn golden brown on all sides. Remove them from the oil and drain on paper towels to remove excess oil.</li>
  <li>Your delicious Egg Rolls are now ready to be served! Serve them with your favorite dipping sauce.</li>
